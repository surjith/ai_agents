# Fundamentals Agent

This is an ai agent that will do fundamental analysis of a company based on publically available information.

This agent is being built as a part of my attempt to learn how ai agents can be built and used via code.
## Version 1:
    Analyse the fundamentals of Apple inc. using publically available data such as Revenue, Gross Margins, Operating Margins etc. for the last 2 years (8 quarters)
